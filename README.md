## Introduction to Cobol

A repository of programming exercises from the book [Beginning COBOL for programmers, Michael Coughlan](https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781430262534#:~:text=Beginning%20COBOL%20for%20Programmers%20is%20a%20comprehensive%2C%20sophisticated%20tutorial%20and,add%20COBOL%20to%20your%20repertoire.). I'm reading the above text as part of my study for CS399 COBOL and Legacy Systems
